# Scripted provisioning with the 1Password CLI tool. 

This script uses 1Password's Command Line Tool v2, in combination with Bash, to read names and email addresses from a file on disk and invite each person on the last to join a 1Password Business account. 


## Account setup
1. Make sure you enable provisioning via the CLI on your 1Password account by visiting https://start.1password.com/settings/provisioning/cli
2. Ensure that the user who is logged into the CLI and running the script is a member of the Provision Managers group.
